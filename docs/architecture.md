# Architecture

Ultimate SSRF Framework is organized around a few core areas:

1. Target handling
2. Endpoint discovery
3. SSRF testing modules
4. Callback/OAST payload generation
5. WAF fingerprinting
6. Reporting and exports

The current public version keeps most of the logic in a single Python entrypoint for easier testing and distribution.

The next refactor will move the main components into a proper Python package structure.
